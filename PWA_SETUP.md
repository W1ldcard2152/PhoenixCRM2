## üõ† Testing the PWA

### Local Testing
1. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Serve the build (currently running on port 3001):
   ```bash
   cd src/client && npx serve -s build -p 3001
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3001` in Chrome/Edge

### PWA Features to Test

#### ‚úÖ Installation
- [ ] Install prompt appears (Chrome: address bar install button)
- [ ] App installs successfully
- [ ] App opens in standalone mode (no browser UI)
- [ ] App icon appears on desktop/home screen

#### ‚úÖ Offline Functionality
- [ ] App loads when offline
- [ ] Cached data displays correctly
- [ ] Offline indicator appears when disconnected

### Browser Developer Tools Testing

1. **Application Tab**:
   - Check "Manifest" section for proper PWA configuration
   - Verify "Service Workers" shows active worker
   - Inspect "Storage" for cached resources

2. **Network Tab**:
   - Throttle to "Offline" to test offline functionality
   - Check "(from ServiceWorker)" labels on cached requests

3. **Lighthouse Audit**:
   - Run PWA audit (should score 90+ for PWA features)
   - Check Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices

## üéØ Key Features

### Smart Caching
- **Automatic Cache Management**: Old caches automatically cleaned up
- **Strategic Caching**: Different strategies for different content types
